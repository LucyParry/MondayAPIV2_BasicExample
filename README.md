# Monday.com API V2 - BasicExample
A simple example of calling the v2 GraphQL API for Monday.com in .NET using <code>HttpClient</code> and <code>Newtonsoft.JSON</code> 

More info about GraphQL in general can be found on the <a href="https://graphql.org/learn/">GraphQL official docs</a> (this was my first time working with it and it's pretty cool!). 
For the Monday.com API specifically, see their <a href="https://monday.com/developers/v2">API v2 docs</a> or the useful <a href="https://monday.com/developers/v2/try-it-yourself">GraphiQL interface</a>
